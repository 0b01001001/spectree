|Documentation Status|

Yet another library to generate OpenAPI document and validate request &
response with Python annotations.

Features
--------

-  Less boilerplate code, annotations are really easy-to-use
-  Generate API document with `Redoc UI`_ or `Swagger UI`_
-  Validate query, JSON data, response data with `pydantic`_
-  Current support:

   -  Flask
   -  Falcon (including Falcon ASGI)
   -  Starlette

Quick Start
-----------

install with pip: ``pip install spectree``

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Check the `examples`_ folder.

Step by Step
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Define your data structure used in (query, json, headers, cookies,
   resp) with ``pydantic.BaseModel``
2. create ``spectree.SpecTree`` instance with the web framework name you
   are using, like ``api = SpecTree('flask')``
3. ``api.validate`` decorate the route with

   -  ``query``
   -  ``json``
   -  ``headers``
   -  ``cookies``
   -  ``resp``
   -  ``tags``

4. access these data with ``context(query, json, headers, cookies)`` (of
   course, you can access these from the original place where the
   framework offered)

   -  flask: ``request.context``
   -  falcon: ``req.context``
   -  starlette: ``request.context``

5. register to the web application ``api.register(app)``
6. check the document at URL location ``/apidoc/redoc`` or
   ``/apidoc/swagger``

FAQ

   ValidationError: missing field for headers

The HTTP headersâ€™ keys in Flask are capitalized, in Falcon are upper
cases, in Starlette are lower cases.
